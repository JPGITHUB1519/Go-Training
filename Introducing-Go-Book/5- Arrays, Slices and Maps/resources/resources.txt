1. How do you access the fourth element of an array or slice?

    arr[3]

2. What is the length of a slice created using make([]int, 3, 9)?
    Lenght : 3
    Capacity : 9slic

3. Given the following array, what would x[2:5] give you?

    x := [6]string{"a","b","c","d","e","f"} [2:5]

    result : {"c", "d","e"}

4. Write a program that finds the smallest number in this list:

x := []int{ 48,96,86,68,
        57,82,63,70,
        37,34,83,27,
        19,97, 9,17,
