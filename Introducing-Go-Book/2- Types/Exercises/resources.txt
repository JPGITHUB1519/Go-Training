1. How are integers stored on a computer?
    They are stored representing bits

2. We know that (in base 10) the largest one-digit number is 9 and the largest two-
digit number is 99. Given that in binary the largest two-digit number is 11 (3), the largest three-digit number is 111 (7) and the largest four-digit number is 1111 (15), what’s the largest eight-digit number? (Hint: 101−1 = 9 and 102−1 = 99)

3. Although overpowered for the task, you can use Go as a calculator. Write a pro‐ gram that computes 32,132 × 42,452 and prints it to the terminal (use the * oper‐ ator for multiplication).

    Program

4. What is a string? How do you find its length?
    A string is a sequence of characters. We can find his length in the Go Programming Language like so : len(string)

5. What’s the valueof the expression (true && false) || (false && true)|| !(false && false)?

    True-> Result
